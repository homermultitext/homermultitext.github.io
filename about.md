The Homer Multitext project is creating an open, replicable, and verifiable scholarly archive of material documenting the transmission of the Homeric *Iliad*.  The project's web site is <http://www.homermultitext.org>.  On <http://homermultitext.github.io>, we present our work in progress:  the archival data sets we are developing, the code libraries we are using to create and validate them, and documentation of how we are assembling the archive.
