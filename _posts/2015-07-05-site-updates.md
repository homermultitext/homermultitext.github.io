title: Web site reorganized
layout: post
---

We've begun the long process of overhauling the entire set of web pages served here at <http://homermultitext.github.io>.  The home page has been reduced to a handful of links to main sections of the site, and the navigational menu keeps those same links available at all times.

We're building the site from markdown source using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and hosting it as [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).   Some main sections (the HMT archive and HMT document sections) are actuallly independent github repositories with their own `gh-pages` branch.  We've revised all of these projects to use the same layouts and CSS, but still need to coordinate the navigational menus in these subprojects.  And of course try to keep documentation close to current in a fast-moving project...
