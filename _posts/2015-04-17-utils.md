title: HMT utilities library
---

The `hmt-utils` library is a JVM package for analyzing editions of texts that follow the HMT project [guidelines for editors](http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-editors-guide/).  It now has its own home page on this site at <http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-utils/>.

The current focus of work on `hmt-utils` is to complete a pair of context-aware tokenization systems.  One system analyzes a pure *diplomatic perspsective* on the edition (e.g., abbreviations are not expanded, no supplied text is included), the other analyzes an *editorial perspective* on the edition (e.g., abbreviations expanded).

Track news here for updates as we continue to integrate the digital text of our guidelines with working code to enforce those guidelines.
