The 2015 summer seminar at the Center for Hellenic Studies ended this week.  We owe a debt of thanks to all the participants. Together with a team at the College of the Holy Cross that is continuing to work on HMT editions throughout July, they have helped us test and pull together an increasingly thorough set of project documentation, available at <http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-docs/>.

The documentation is organized in sections covering the prerequisite technologies we require to edit material for the HMT project, how to build and use the 2015 version of the HMT virtual machine for editors, and the HMT project's "total editing" process that we follow to create digital diplomatic editions.  It also has a section of tips and links to reference material that previous contributors have found useful.
