# About This Directory

This `dist/` directory is here to maintain backwards compatibility with sites that use the pre-2.0 version of Water.css.

We used to encourage linking to this directory instead of the version on NPM (since it didn't exist) so this exists to avoid breaking anything.

If you're still using a version from this directory please see the README to update. If you're a contributor, ignore this - **you're probably looking for `out/`**.
